Exercises
    1) Create a class Book with instance variables title, author, and price. Add a method displayDetails() that prints the book details. Create multiple Book objects in the main method and call displayDetails().

    2) Modify the Book class from the previous exercise to include
        A default constructor that sets default values.
        A parameterized constructor that initializes values based on user input.
        A method to display book details.

    3) Create a class BankAccount with private variables: accountNumber, accountHolder, and balance. Implement getter and setter methods for these variables. Test them in a main method to update and display account details.
    4) Write a Java class Calculator that has overloaded methods to perform addition
        add(int a, int b)
        add(double a, double b)
        add(int a, int b, int c)
        Test these methods in the main method.

    5) Create a class Employee with instance variables: id, name, salary. Use the this keyword to initialize values through a constructor. Display the details using a method.

    6) Create a class Student with instance variables name and rollNumber and a static variable schoolName. Assign schoolName a common value for all students. Create multiple Student objects and display their details.

    7) Create a class Car with a final method showDetails(). Try to override it in a subclass SportsCar and observe the error.

        Accepts a full name as input and extracts the first name using substring().
        Converts the name into uppercase and lowercase.
